A README file is the first thing people see when they visit your project on GitHub. You should add it to the **root directory** of your repository. This ensures it's the main page people see when they open your project.

Here is a full template you can copy and paste into a new file named `README.md`. It includes all the sections we discussed, such as a banner, features, getting started instructions, and more.

# 🐉 DragonHunter: The Ultimate Bug Bounty Scanner 🐉

\!

DragonHunter is an automated, all-in-one reconnaissance and bug bounty tool written in Bash. This script combines several powerful security tools into a single workflow to help you quickly gather information and identify potential vulnerabilities on a target domain.

Designed for efficiency and ease of use, DragonHunter is perfect for bug bounty hunters and penetration testers looking to streamline their initial reconnaissance phase.

-----

## ✨ Features

  * **Dependency Check**: Automatically verifies that essential tools like `nmap`, `curl`, `gobuster`, `subfinder`, `figlet`, and `lolcat` are installed.
  * **Port Scanning**: Uses **Nmap** to scan for open ports and identify potential vulnerabilities.
  * **Subdomain Enumeration**: Leverages **Subfinder** to discover hidden subdomains of a target.
  * **Directory Brute-forcing**: Employs **Gobuster** to uncover hidden directories and files.
  * **Vulnerability Probing**: Performs basic checks for common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Host Header Injection.

-----

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

DragonHunter relies on several open-source tools. Before you begin, please ensure you have them installed. The script includes a check and will exit if a tool is missing.

For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, you can install them with a single command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nmap curl gobuster subfinder figlet lolcat
```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/DragonHunter.git
    cd DragonHunter
    ```
2.  **Make the script executable**:
    ```bash
    chmod +x dragonhunter.sh
    ```

-----

### 🐲 Usage

To start a scan, simply run the script with your target URL:

```bash
./dragonhunter.sh <target_url>
```

**Example:**

```bash
./dragonhunter.sh https://example.com
```

## 📜 How It Works

DragonHunter automates a sequence of reconnaissance steps:

1.  **Port Scan**: Scans ports 80 and 443 with Nmap.
2.  **Endpoint Discovery**: Searches for common web parameters to identify potential injection points.
3.  **Vulnerability Checks**: Tests for basic SQLi, XSS, and Host Header Injection payloads on discovered endpoints.
4.  **Subdomain Scan**: Finds subdomains using Subfinder.
5.  **Directory Brute-force**: Attempts to find common directories and files on the target using Gobuster.

All results are saved to text files in the same directory, making it easy to review the findings after the scan is complete.
